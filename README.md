# IsItTrue
A trivia game app created using Firebase Realtime database.
If you want to check the app in action, you can find it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkinghats.isittrue)

You'll have to create a new project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and download the **google-services.json** file and replace it in this project for it to work.
A sample "**is-it-true-export.json**" file is also attached which shows the structure of the database, this should be enough to get you started.
